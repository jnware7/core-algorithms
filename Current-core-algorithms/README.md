# Stretch

 - [ ] Pick a different programming language from JavaScript (e.g. Ruby, Swift, Python, C, Javaâ€¦) and write tests & implementations for each.

  - [ ] Can run all non-JavaScript tests with a single command.
 - [ ]  For each algorithm identified above, there is a test file with multiple unit tests for each algorithm in a language other than JavaScript.
  - [ ] For each algorithm identified above, there is an implementation file with a correct implementation of the algorithm in a language other than JavaScript.
